Deep Learning with PyTorch

This Repository is about various Deep Learning algorithmsand how to built it using PyTorch Library.

In this notebook I have built 3 Neural Networks:

1. Feed Forward Neural Network
2. Convolutional NeuralNetwork
3. ResNet34

Also I have compared the performance of each Neural Network.
